## Sudoku-110B

# Project Description: 
This project is about using optimization method to solve sudoku problems. In the sudoku_solver.py file, I use the linear programming method based on the given example from class kaggle page to solve sudoku problems. It is trying to minimize the objective funtion and set the rules of sudoku to be the constraints. The accuracy rate is not high but acceptable. 
# How to Run: 
Download the sudoku_solver.py file and put the data that you are going to use in the same folder as sudoku_solver.py. Then the code could run.
